// This comparison function is used for 'natural' string sorting. It detects numbers in strings and sorts them in a way
// that makes sense to humans, by comparing the value rather than the binary representation. It does this by padding the
// numbers with zeros until they have the same length. Normally numbers are padded from the left, however if a number is
// followed by a decimal dot followed by a second number, the second number is considered a fractional part, and will be
// padded from the right. For example, when comparing the strings "X 1.2" and "X 12.345", the comparison will behave as
// if the first string was actually "X 01.200". If two numbers have the same numerical value, the one with the highest
// number of leading/trailing zeros is considered to be greater. For example, "12" < "012" and "1.2" < "1.20".
